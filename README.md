## Server Requirements

The Laravel framework has a few system requirements. All of these requirements are satisfied by the [Laravel Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/homestead) virtual machine, so it's highly recommended that you use Homestead as your local Laravel development environment.

However, if you are not using Homestead, you will need to make sure your server meets the following requirements:

 - PHP >= 7.2.0
 - BCMath PHP Extension
 - Ctype PHP Extension
 - JSON PHP Extension
 - Mbstring PHP Extension
 - OpenSSL PHP Extension
 - PDO PHP Extension
 - Tokenizer PHP Extension
 - XML PHP Extension

## Start The Game!

1. Laravel utilizes [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage its dependencies. So, before using Laravel, make sure you have Composer installed on your machine.
2. Extract application folder, put in your server (ex: htdocs folder)
3. Import database
4. create project:
    laravel new parking_lot
